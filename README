
Units::Base contains some low-level string parsing and conversion routines
that can be used by other modules to convert between units of measurement
(such as millimeters to feet or points to picas or even millimeters to
sixteenths-of-an-inch).

Among the nicities (I think so anyway...) of this unit are synonyms and
abbreviations for units, and the ability to use multipliers (so that
you need only define a unit once but specify conversions based on
"hundreths of an inch" etc.
